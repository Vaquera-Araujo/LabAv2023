# The Time-Dependent and Time-Independent Schrödinger Equations


## Introduction

The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of quantum systems. It comes in two forms: the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the time-independent Schrödinger equation. In this document, we will provide a brief overview of both equations.

## Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is given by:

$i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi$

where $\Psi$ represents the wave function of the quantum system, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.

This equation describes the wave function $\Psi$ dynamics. The left-hand side represents the rate of change of the wave function, while the right-hand side represents the action of the Hamiltonian operator on the wave function.

## Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation

The time-independent Schrödinger equation is an eigenvalue equation that allows us to determine the stationary states and corresponding energies of a quantum system. It is given by:

$\hat{H} \psi = E \psi$

where $\psi$ represents the stationary state wave function, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, $E$ is the energy of the stationary state, and $\psi$ is the eigenfunction.

Solving this equation involves finding the eigenvalues $E$ and the corresponding eigenfunctions $\psi$ of the Hamiltonian operator. The eigenvalues represent the possible energies of the system, while the eigenfunctions represent the corresponding wave functions.
